minidlna (1.1.6+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  With this version of minidlna new config option appears: wide_links. By
  default it's turned off and disallows access to files outside media_dirs
  even if symlinks from media_dirs point to them.

  If you have symlinks in you media_dirs (/var/lib/minidlna by default) and
  want to access them via minidlna do not forget to turn wide_links on.

  See minidlna.conf(5) or comments in config file itself for details.
